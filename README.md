# Technical Test (0 - 3 Years Innovation Team)

Jisc provides services and supports the Further Education (FE) and Higher Education (HE) sector. Often, these institutions come to us with problems, and we try to solve them. The following is an example project which we'd like you to complete.

University administrators send lots of emails. These emails often contain links that are huge (100+ characters). Since the links are so large, students are often put off by them and don't click them, this leads to them missing important content. What the university wants is a URL shortener that can turn a long link, into a short link. E.g

> https://example.com/this-is-ann-example-of-a-really-long-link-that-may-look-bad/i-wish-i-could-shorten-this

to

> https://jisc.ac.uk/H7DXS2

**Important information**:

-   We want the short URL to be as small as technically possible. The university will send 5 emails per week, with 5 links in each email.
-   When the short link is clicked, it should redirect me to the long link.
-   The short link should **always** link to the same long link.

**What we need from you**

Using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) create a UI alongside an API. You can use whichever database you want to store the data.

If you have never done frontend work, don't worry, just have a go at the API and have a think about what the UI may look like.

If you have never done backend work (or aren't as comfortable with it), create a frontend in React, using [Material UI (MUI)](https://material-ui.com/) and have a think about what you would expect the API to do.

We would recommend you don't spend more than a couple of hours on this project, and if you don't finish it, don't worry. We understand that 2 hours work is not going to produce a piece of art.

In the interview we will ask you what you would have done differently if you had a day, or a week. Would you have done TDD? Would you address certain bottlenecks?
